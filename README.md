  ## Description 
  We all live such busy lives and we tend to forget things. Being able to work this project to refactor a note taking application helps with being able to take notes as a way to remember what we have to get done for the day or pick up from the store. Being able to incorporate different routes in regards to html/api's to get information from GET and POST requests is interesting. Also learning how to make a delete request has been challenging but fun at the same time.

  ## Tests
  Trial and error. Inputting node server.js and clicking on http://localhost:3000 would lead to the webpage before it was deployed on heroku. It gave me the opportunity to test the code to see what was working and what was not.

  ## Questions
  How do you deploy an applicaiton on heroku?
